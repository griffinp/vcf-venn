vcf-venn:
A tool to compare variants contained within multiple vcf format files, to determine variants unique to each file, and variants that are common to each possible combination of files.  

It should be used to compare vcf files resulting from a comparison to the same reference genome.

This tool will write the variants to new files, also in vcf format: one containing the variants unique to each original file, and one containing the variants common to each combination.

The files follow this venn diagram format:

file 1 uniq
file 2 uniq
file 3 uniq
file 1, 2 common not 3
file 1, 3 common not 2
file 2, 3 common not 1
common to all

It also outputs a list of the number of variants unique or common to each combination. 

vcf-venn.py is the script.
